    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This is still only my <strong>first</strong> day of coding. It's about muscle memory and trying to remeber what I already knew
    It's a <em>proccess</em> and I've jus <strong>barely</strong> touched the surface.
    </p>
    <h2>Thought Proccess</h2>
    <p>My thought proccess isn't to try and memorize <strong>everything</strong> on my first day or even my first week, it's more so about getting my feet wet and gaining knowledge bit by bit on the worl of coding.
        Like this whole <em>"article"</em> I made using html code (which in my opionon is the <strong>easiest</strong> coding languange that I've dwelled into).
        This whole <em>"article"</em> is essentially me jus getting the basics for html and what it has to offer.
    </p>
    <h3>My future</h3>
    <p>
    In the future I want to become a <em>full stack developer</em>. What that is, is a developer who can use <strong>front end code</strong> and <strong>back end code</strong>. 
    There's jobs like <em>front end developer</em> (only know how to use front end code), and <em>back end developer</em> (only know how to use back end code), and there's <strong>nothing</strong> wrong with either one of those positions, but I jus want to be well versed in as many aspects of coding as I can.
    </p>
    <h4>How I'm gunna get there</h4>
    <p>
        How i'm gunna get to becoming a <em>full stack developer</em> is simply by <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>practicing</strong>.
